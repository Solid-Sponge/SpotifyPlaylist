# SpotifyPlaylist

This is a Python script to interact with the Spotify API and create a playlist on your profile of the top three songs by a list
of artists contained in the array "artists" in the get_youtube_tracks() method.

To interact with the Spotify API, visit the Spotify website for developers. Log in, start a project, then get your
client_id and client_secret to enable you to request a token from Spotify to interact with the API:

This script was largely based on the code provided by Leigh at Medium:

This article describes the process of getting a token to interact with the Spotify API, as well as the 
method to search for and get songs for artists which was a huge help in writing my script.
